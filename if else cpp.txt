Scenario 1: Access Control
You are developing a simple login system. Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a username
and password. If both the username and password match predefined values, grant access.
Otherwise, deny access.

Scenario 2: Membership Eligibility
Create a program that checks if a user is eligible for a premium membership based on age and
subscription status. If the user is at least 18 years old and has a valid subscription, provide access;
otherwise, deny access.

Scenario 3: Grade Classification
Design a program that takes a student's numerical grade as input and outputs their corresponding
letter grade. Use if-else statements to categorize the grades as 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F'.

Scenario 4: Shipping Charges
Write a C++ program that calculates shipping charges based on the weight of a package. If the weight
is less than or equal to 5 pounds, apply a flat rate; otherwise, charge an additional fee per pound for
weights exceeding 5 pounds.

Scenario 5: Discount Calculation
You are working for an e-commerce platform. Implement a program that calculates the total cost of
an order after applying discounts. If the order amount is greater than $50 and the user is a premium
member, provide a 10% discount; otherwise, provide a 5% discount.

Scenario 6: Ticket Pricing
Develop a program that determines the price of a movie ticket based on the age of the user and the
time of the movie. If the user is a child (age <= 12), provide a discount. If the movie is a matinee
(before 5 PM), apply an additional discount.

7. **Scenario 7: Authentication System**
Design a program for a secure system that requires two-factor authentication. The user needs to
input both a valid username/password combination and a time-sensitive authentication code. Grant
access only if both conditions are met.

8. **Scenario 8: Voting Eligibility**

Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote. The eligibility criteria include being at
least 18 years old and not having a criminal record. Grant voting access only if both conditions are
satisfied.

9. **Scenario 9: Temperature Classification**
Write a program that classifies the temperature into different categories (cold, moderate, hot). Use
relational operators to compare the temperature input and categorize it accordingly.

10. **Scenario 10: Exam Pass/Fail**
Develop a program that determines whether a student passes or fails an exam based on the input
marks. If the student scores 40% or more, consider it a pass; otherwise, mark it as a fail.

11. **Scenario 11: Library Fine Calculation**
Implement a program for a library that calculates the fine for overdue books. If a book is returned
after the due date, charge a base fine. If it's returned more than a week late, apply an additional fee.

12. **Scenario 12: Product Discount**
Design a program for an online store that applies different discounts based on the user's purchase
history. If a user has made more than 5 purchases, offer a 15% discount; otherwise, provide a
standard 10% discount.

Scenario 13: Event Invitation
Create a program for an exclusive event. Users are invited if they are either VIP guests or have
purchased a premium ticket. Use the OR logical operator to check the conditions and grant access
accordingly.

Scenario 14: Password Recovery
Design a simple password recovery system. Allow access if the user provides either the correct
password or a valid recovery code. Ensure that users can gain access if either condition is satisfied.
