Solved

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Ans:-

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int minPrice = INT_MAX;
    int maxProfit = INT_MIN;

    for(int i = 0 ; i < prices.size() ; i++)
    {
        minPrice = min(prices[i],minPrice);
        int profitToday = prices[i]-minPrice;
        maxProfit = max(profitToday,maxProfit);
    }

    if(maxProfit>0){
        return maxProfit;
    }
    return 0;
    }
};
